# cpnt262 Graded Assessment 3: Objects and Arrays

## Practical Uses
### Arrays
- push: in the case of online shopping, could use this to add an item to the shopping cart array
- filter: when searching on a website for information/products this could help narrow down a search
- includes: when logging in to a website could use find to make sure the entered username exists in an array of usernames
### Objects
- you can use new Date to display the date on your website or create a clock that displays the time
- object.freeze could maybe be used for security purposes?
- object.delete could be used to delete a certain piece of user info the user has requested to be deleted

### Code Journal
- I found the array methods that required defining an arrow function inside like filter helped me understand the arrow function syntax better because im used to the old fashioned way.
